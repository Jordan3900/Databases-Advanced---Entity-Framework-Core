                                                 About the course

I have worked with ORM technology: Entity Framework (EF), which is a standard ORM standard in C # and .NET applications . EF allows mapping between a relational base and object-oriented model using the "database first" and "code first" approaches and provides a powerful object-oriented API for querying the database and performing CRUD operations . I will demonstrate established practices in building a database layer on sophisticated systems using the " Repository " and " Unit of Work " templates .

During the course a practical team project will be developed that includes practical use of different DB servers ( SQL Server , MySQL ), data access platforms and technologies ( ADO.NET , Entity Framework, etc.) and import and export to various formats for data ( JSON , XML ).

This is the system in which I'm submiting and testing the exercises - https://judge.softuni.bg/
